# PixelPainter
(c) 2016 Jack Blaney, Emily Mattlin, Matteo de Donato

Pixelpainter is an open-source, web-based image editting enviornment.
It uses the open-source javascript processing API [p5js](p5js.org).

###Requirements
Link to requirements sheet [here](https://trinityschoolnyc.myschoolapp.com/ftpimages/390/download/download_1789690.pdf)

> ####Part I: ​Create a basic pixel drawing experience.
>Picture the eventual evolution of your Pixel Painter program. When in doubt, mimic the behavior of MS Paint.
>Each group must implement:
> - **Pencil**: 
  * draws in color 1 or color 2 based on which mouse button is pressed
  * default mode
> - **Eraser**: ​draws in color2
> - **Rectangle/Ellipse**: ​draws a rectangle/ellipse outlined with color 1 and filled with color 2. Use double buffering to see the “growth”.
> - **Line**:​draws a straight line between two points. Use double buffering to see the “growth”.
> - **Thickness**: ​changes the thickness of lines, the outlines of shapes, the diameter of the pencil/brush
> - **Color**: ​color 1, color 2, default palette, custom palette, extension: option for transparency
> - **Droplet**:​​replace color 1 or color 2 with the color of the selected pixel based on which mouse button is pressed. 
> Icon changes to eye droplet.
> - **Pixel Tracker**: ​outputs the current position of the mouse cursor

>#####Each group must also implement at least 3 of the following tools:
>  *brush (multiple style choices), paint bucket, stamp, triangle, Bezier curve, gridlines, text, spray can, clone tool, crop
> - Users should be able to save their image in either the .png or .jpg format.

> ####Part II: ​Add support for photos and filters
> - **Extension**: Users should be able to open a .jpg, .png, or .gif image to add to the canvas. Incorrect file types should > output an error message and not cause the program to crash.
> - **Extension**: Implement your own image format. Save 24­bit color information for your entire canvas. Allow users to load >or save images in this format.
> - **Implement at least six non­trivial photo filters (two per person).** At least one filter per person must incorporate 
> *Perlin noise*. Do not use the built­in P5 filters. Your
> filters should be significantly more advanced than the filters from the Technology: Creativity class. Feel free to add 
> other basic filters (like b&W, warm/cool) to
> your project, but you won’t receive credit for implementing those filters. Allow the user to control at least two 
> parameters of each filter.
> - **Possible filters include:**
> - Pixelate/Pointillize
> - steganography with Encrypt/Decrypt features­ Embed a message in the RGB values on the color
> - Noise/Grain/Speckle using Perlin noise
> - Kaleidoscope­ sophisticated symmetries
> - Blur
> - Posterize
> - Contrast
> - ASCII/Emoji filter – Change the photo into an ASCII or emoji drawing
> - Oil Paint
> - Watercolor
> - Printing Press
> - Or, create your own!
> - **Extension​**: Add professional features. (depending on time, probably optional since only one group got to it last year)
>­Select, resize, rotate, zoom, layers, canvas size

###Our Progress

####Tools
- **Watercolor** 
- **Pencil**
- **Eraser**
- **Spray Can**
- **Paintbrush**
- **Line**
  * click to define the first point, and click again to define endpoint
- **Rectangle**
  * click to define one point and click again to define its opposite
- **Dropper** 
  * to replace one of the color spots with a color on your canvas, click dropper, click the color you want, and then double click the color spot you wish to replace.
  * the dropper uses the ```pixels[]``` array built into *pfjs*
  * doesn't work if you have sliders —— sliders automatically resetting color you change it to
  * need to find a way to change slider values
- **Color 1 & Color2**  
  * to select, **double click**. Default value of both is ```(0, 0, 0)```.
- **Color Sliders**
  * the first collumn sets the r, g, and b value for color 1
  * the seconf collumn sets the r, g, and b value for color 2
  * the lone slider adjusts the thickness

####Phase 1
- ~~line (growing) -- Emily will upload~~
- ~~rectangle~~/ellipse
- thickness
- ~~*dropper*~~ —— does not work on retina `displayDensity` 
  * should be fine; computers in lab are normal density 
- ~~save file as jpg or png~~

####to add to main branch:
- Jack's color sliders
- ~~Emily's lines~~

###What we need to accomplish *April 7* before due
- ~~merge Matteo's dropper code w/ Jack's color setup~~
- ~~add ellipses~~
- ~~add triangles??~~
  * ~~we need another tool — can we use code for rectangle?~~
- ~~thickness~~
 * ~~Jack do you have this already?~~
- dropper is kind of weird — works but have to double click
  * also, need cursor icon
  * Emily has it for other tools
- ~~what to do about the marker~~
  * ~~requirements say 3 alternate brushes —~~
  * ~~marker was just larger pencil~~
  * ~~I changed it so that it was basically just a translucent pencil —— looks watercolor-ish~~
  * ~~looks good only when marker is big~~
  * ~~should we rename it?~~
