###Our Progress

####Phase 1
- ~~line (growing) -- Emily will upload~~
- ~~rectangle~~/ellipse
- thickness
- ~~*dropper*~~ —— does not work on retina `displayDensity` 
  * should be fine; computers in lab are normal density 
- ~~save file as jpg or png~~

####to add to main branch:
- Jack's color sliders
- ~~Emily's lines~~

###What we need to accomplish *April 7* before due
- merge Matteo's dropper code w/ Jack's color setup
- add ellipses
- add triangles??
  * we need another tool — can we use code for rectangle?
- ~~thickness~~
 * ~~Jack do you have this already?~~
- dropper is kind of weird — works but have to double click
  * also, need cursor icon
  * Emily has it for other tools
- what to do about the marker
  * requirements say 3 alternate brushes —
  * marker was just larger pencil
  * I changed it so that it was basically just a translucent pencil —— looks watercolor-ish
  * looks good only when marker is big
  * should we rename it?
